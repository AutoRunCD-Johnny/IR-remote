//different between ON/OFF
//1. the no.4 in list1. 1 is ON, 0 is OFF.
//2. the no.32 in list2 would be inverted.
//the last digit in list2 can be either 1 or 0.

//OFF can be in any temp.

//the temp is from no.9 to no.12 of list1. The 16 deg is 0000, 17 is 1000, 18 is 0100 and so on(increment 4bit then invert). 
//no.7 is swinging enable digit. 1 is enable, 0 is disable. then the no.1 in list2 is up_down bit, no.5 is left_rigit bit.
